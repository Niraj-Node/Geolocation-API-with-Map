# Geolocation-Based Application

This application demonstrates using the Geolocation API to display the current location on a map.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the HTML file (`index.html`) with your appropriate Google Maps API key. If you want to quickly see the map functionality in action (works only on a local server), you can use the sample API key provided below:

   **Note:** Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the script tag with the following API key: "AIzaSyB41DRUbKWJHPxaFjMAwdrzWzbVKartNGg"

This key is provided as an example and should not be used in a production environment.

3. Launch the application on a local server or web server.

4. Click the "Show" button to display the current location on the map.

5. Use the "Reset" button to clear the displayed location.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and interface of the application.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet file containing the design and layout styles.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file handling the Geolocation API and map functionality.

## Note

Ensure you have a valid Google Maps API key to utilize the Google Maps JavaScript API services. If you don't have a key, follow the Google Maps Platform documentation to generate one.

**Important:** Never expose your API keys publicly or commit them to version control systems. Utilize environment variables or other secure methods to handle sensitive keys in production.

For further details on Google Maps API and usage guidelines, refer to [Google Maps Platform Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation).
